# 🚕 Uber Ride Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
## 🏁 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize Uber ride operations and business performance using Power BI.
This dashboard helps stakeholders understand booking trends, revenue performance, ride completion status, customer behavior, and vehicle-wise insights for better data-driven decision-making.

## 📌 Problem Statement

- Ride-hailing platforms like Uber generate massive amounts of data daily. Without a centralized analytics system, it becomes difficult to:
 - Track completed, cancelled, and incomplete rides.
 - Monitor revenue trends across months and vehicle types.
 - Analyze customer behavior and ratings.
 - Identify top pickup & drop locations.
 - Compare performance of Auto, Bike, Sedan, XL, etc.
- This Power BI dashboard solves these challenges by providing a single interactive view of all key operational and financial metrics.
